# Stack Implementation

This repository contains a simple and efficient implementation of the **Stack** data structure, a fundamental concept in computer science used to store and manage data with a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** approach.

## Features

- **Core Operations**:
  - `Push`: Add elements to the stack.
  - `Pop`: Remove the top element from the stack.
  - `Top`: View the top element without removing it.
  - `IsEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.
- Easy-to-understand code, making it suitable for learning and practice.
- Includes examples for common stack use cases.

## Use Cases of Stacks

- **Expression Evaluation**: Convert or evaluate infix, postfix, or prefix expressions.
- **Backtracking**: Navigate backward in applications like maze solving or browser history.
- **Recursion Management**: Manage function calls using stacks.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implement features in text editors or other applications.
